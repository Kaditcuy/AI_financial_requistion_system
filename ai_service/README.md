``` numpy ->
numpy is a fundamental library for numerical computing in Python. Here’s how it can be useful:

Numerical Operations: It provides support for large multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. This is useful for any numerical computations you may need for financial data analysis.

Performance: Numpy operations are generally faster than regular Python operations because they are implemented in C. This can significantly speed up calculations when working with large datasets.

Integration with Other Libraries: Many data science libraries, including pandas and scikit-learn, are built on top of NumPy, so it serves as a foundational library for numerical operations in your financial requisition system.```

# AI Services Directory

The `ai_services` directory contains all Python scripts for implementing AI services within the financial requisition system. This directory leverages essential Python libraries for machine learning and data analysis to enhance the functionality of the system.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Activate Virtual Environment**  
   Before installing any Python packages and dependencies, ensure that you activate the virtual environment in the parent directory. This helps manage project-specific dependencies without affecting the global Python environment.

   ```bash
   source ../venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
   .\venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows

   ```

2. **Install Essential Python Packages**
   Install the following essential Python packages:

   ```pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy

   ```

# Python Packages Overview

## scikit-learn

`scikit-learn` is a widely used machine learning library that provides tools to build and train machine learning models for various tasks, including:

- **Predicting Customer Behavior**: Use machine learning models to forecast how customers will interact with your financial requisition system.
- **Forecasting Inventory Needs**: Leverage algorithms to predict future inventory requirements based on historical data.
- **Optimizing Financial Requisition Processes**: Implement models to streamline and enhance the requisition workflow.

This library includes essential tools for data preparation before feeding it into machine learning models. For categorizing requisition requests or segmenting customers based on behavior, `scikit-learn` offers algorithms for clustering (e.g., K-Means) and classification (e.g., decision trees, support vector machines).
