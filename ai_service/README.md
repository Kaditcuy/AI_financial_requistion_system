  `scikit-learn -> Popular machine learning library (Use it to build and train machine learning models for various tasks, such as predicting customer behavior, forecasting inventory needs, or optimizing financial requisition processes. Provides tools that is essential for preparing data before feeding it into machine learning models. If your system needs to categorize requisition requests or segment customers based on their behavior, scikit-learn provides algorithms for clustering (like K-Means) and classification (like decision trees or support vector machines).)`

````pandas -> is a powerful data manipulation and analysis library. Here’s how it can be useful: Data Structures: It provides data structures like DataFrames, which are ideal for handling tabular data (e.g., customer requisition records). This makes it easier to analyze and manipulate your data.

Data Cleaning and Preparation: You can easily clean and prepare your data for analysis, including handling missing values, filtering rows, and aggregating data.

Time Series Analysis: If your system deals with time-sensitive data (like transaction history), pandas offers robust functionalities for time series analysis, which can help in forecasting and trend analysis.

Integration with Other Libraries: It works seamlessly with other libraries like NumPy and scikit-learn, enabling you to perform complex data analysis and machine learning tasks efficiently. ```

``` numpy ->
numpy is a fundamental library for numerical computing in Python. Here’s how it can be useful:

Numerical Operations: It provides support for large multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. This is useful for any numerical computations you may need for financial data analysis.

Performance: Numpy operations are generally faster than regular Python operations because they are implemented in C. This can significantly speed up calculations when working with large datasets.

Integration with Other Libraries: Many data science libraries, including pandas and scikit-learn, are built on top of NumPy, so it serves as a foundational library for numerical operations in your financial requisition system.```
