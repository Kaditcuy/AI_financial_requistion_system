# AI Services Directory

The `ai_services` directory contains all Python scripts for implementing AI services within the financial requisition system. This directory leverages essential Python libraries for machine learning and data analysis to enhance the functionality of the system.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Activate Virtual Environment**  
   Before installing any Python packages and dependencies, ensure that you activate the virtual environment in the parent directory. This helps manage project-specific dependencies without affecting the global Python environment.

   ```bash
   source ../venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
   .\venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows

   ```

2. **Install Essential Python Packages**
   Install the following essential Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy

   ```

# Python Packages Overview

## scikit-learn

`scikit-learn` is a widely used machine learning library that provides tools to build and train machine learning models for various tasks, including:

- **Predicting Customer Behavior**: Use machine learning models to forecast how customers will interact with your financial requisition system.
- **Forecasting Inventory Needs**: Leverage algorithms to predict future inventory requirements based on historical data.
- **Optimizing Financial Requisition Processes**: Implement models to streamline and enhance the requisition workflow.

This library includes essential tools for data preparation before feeding it into machine learning models. For categorizing requisition requests or segmenting customers based on behavior, `scikit-learn` offers algorithms for clustering (e.g., K-Means) and classification (e.g., decision trees, support vector machines).

## pandas

`pandas` is a powerful library for data manipulation and analysis, providing the following features:

- **Data Structures**: Offers DataFrames, which are ideal for handling tabular data (e.g., customer requisition records), making it easier to analyze and manipulate data.
- **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Streamlines the process of cleaning and preparing data for analysis, including handling missing values, filtering rows, and aggregating data.
- **Time Series Analysis**: Provides robust functionalities for analyzing time-sensitive data (e.g., transaction history), which aids in forecasting and trend analysis.
- **Integration with Other Libraries**: Works seamlessly with other libraries like NumPy and `scikit-learn`, enabling efficient complex data analysis and machine learning tasks.

## numpy

`numpy` is a fundamental library for numerical computing in Python, offering:

- **Numerical Operations**: Supports large multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays, essential for financial data analysis.
- **Performance**: Provides faster performance for numerical operations compared to standard Python implementations, significantly speeding up calculations with large datasets.
- **Integration with Other Libraries**: Serves as a foundational library for numerical operations, with many data science libraries, including `pandas` and `scikit-learn`, built on top of it.

# Directory Structure

## ai_services/

Contains all AI-related Python scripts for implementing machine learning and data analysis functionalities.

### Usage

To run any of the Python scripts, ensure the virtual environment is activated, and use the following command:

```bash
python script_name.py  # Replace with the actual script name

```
